# 3rd Task: Password Complexity Checker Program

As part of my third assignment during the internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I developed a simple Python program tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on several key criteria. The program provides feedback to users, helping them understand the complexity of their passwords and encouraging the creation of stronger, more secure passwords.

## Overview

The Password Complexity Checker analyzes passwords by assessing different characteristics such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It then provides a rating or feedback to the user on the strength of their password, allowing them to improve it if necessary.

## Features

- **Password Length Check**: Ensures that the password meets a minimum length requirement.
- **Character Variety**: Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Strength Feedback**: Provides feedback on their password's strength, encouraging improvements if the password is weak.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
